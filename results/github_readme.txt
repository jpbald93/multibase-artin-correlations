# Correlations of Artin status among primes — consolidated paper

**Paper:** *Correlations of Artin status among primes: consecutive-prime anticorrelation,
cross-base entanglement, and an elementary decomposition*
**Author:** Josh Bald (Independent Researcher, Ontario, Canada)
**Status:** draft, September 2026 — under adversarial audit (Astra + Opus 5.5)

This is a **consolidation** of two earlier preprints — *Correlations between primitive root
statuses of consecutive primes* and *Cross-base correlations of Artin primes* — plus a **new
final section** that audits the computational content of the correlations. The consolidation
was asked for because two thin papers about a −0.014 correlation are a weak submission,
whereas one paper carrying two proved exclusion laws, an exact decomposition at scale, and a
measured negative result is a defensible one.

## How the merge was built

`assemble.py` copies the **technical core sections verbatim** from the two source papers and
stitches in the newly written front matter, data section, audit section and discussion. The
only edits to copied text are: two section titles, renaming of six colliding `\label`s, one
self-citation repair, a wording-only discriminant sentence cleanup, and rendering the
cross-base paper's *set* notation `\mathcal{A}_a` distinctly from the consecutive-prime
*indicator* `\Art_n`. A numeral-preservation check
confirms that **all 1,345 numerals in the source blocks survive unaltered** in the merged
source. Run `python3 assemble.py` to rebuild when the two source papers are available; otherwise
it uses the shipped assembled TeX, and refuses if that TeX does not contain the current
`FRONT.tex`/`SECTION_content.tex`/`DISC.tex`. `bash build_submission.sh` is run from the
**source archive** (`submission/artin_correlations_source.zip`, flat layout), not from a
checkout of this repository, where the TeX sits in `paper/`.

## Reproduce

```bash
# paper
pdflatex artin_correlations && pdflatex artin_correlations && pdflatex artin_correlations

# Lean gate for the exclusion laws (needs the shared Mathlib cache)
cd lean && ./gate.sh            # -> PASS (28 theorems, standard axioms only)

# the audit-section driver
cd code
gcc -O3 -fopenmp -o artin_payoff artin_payoff.c -lm
./artin_payoff census 1000000000        # census + filter soundness + gap law
./artin_payoff ce     1000000000        # cross-entropy: correlation vs elementary baseline
./artin_payoff search3 1000000000000000 300   # timed search: naive vs filtered
```

## What the paper claims

**Two exclusion laws** (both elementary, both proved, both Lean-checked):
- consecutive primes: if `g ≡ 20 (mod 40)` then `10` is a quadratic residue for exactly one of
  `p, p+g`, so they can never both be Artin base 10;
- same prime: with `d = sqf(ab)`, no prime with `(d|p) = −1` is Artin for both `a` and `b`;
  if `sqf(c) = sqf(ab)` then no odd prime is Artin for all three.

**Measurements below 10⁹** (exact counts; 50,847,530 consecutive pairs for the
consecutive-prime statistics): consecutive-prime
anticorrelation `δ = −0.01414` (Pearson 10,167); cross-base correlation `φ(a,b)` positive for
64 of 66 pairs. An exact covariance decomposition places 98.7 % / 99.5 % of `δ` between
joint-residue cells mod 120 / 840 (96.1–99.2 % / 97.8–99.7 % across four weighting conventions);
conditioning on the fine signature of `p−1` removes 95 % of the mean cross-base correlation.

**A measured negative** (new), limited to the estimators and the search workload tested: the
predecessor's Artin status adds `0.000009` nats in-sample to the mod-120 joint-residue baseline,
and a simulation in which statuses depend only on `p mod 840` reproduces that excess without
predecessor-specific information. No held-out estimator gains beyond residues mod 840. Both exclusion laws are
computationally redundant (the same-prime law from character multiplicativity, the gap law from
reciprocity together with it); the quadratic filter expressed by these exclusion laws is the
elementary non-residue test, which a character-aware implementation already applies and the
observed conductor-40 channel expresses.

## Evidence tiers

- **proved** — the two exclusion laws (also Lean-checked, 28 theorems, standard axioms only);
- **verified numerically** — every census statistic, regenerated by the shipped C programs;
- **conjecture / open** — labelled as such in the text (e.g. the persistence conjecture).

## Audit status

Three rounds of adversarial audit by two independent systems, Astra (`gpt-6-astra`) and
Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`); every report is in `reports/`
(`AUDIT_*_artin-correlations.md`, `AUDIT_round2_*.md`, `AUDIT_round3_*.md`). Findings were
verified against code before each change. No audit found an error in a theorem or in a census
count; the corrections concern the wording and statistics of the computational-content section,
the bibliography, and packaging.

**Reproducing Section 15.** Fastest: `zcat results/joint_residue_tables_1e9.txt.gz > t.txt &&
python3 code/section15.py t.txt` reproduces `results/section15_1e9.json` byte for byte (sha256 in
`results/section15_sha256.txt`). From scratch:
`code/artin_payoff dump 1000000000 > results/joint_residue_tables_1e9.txt`
writes the complete cell tables; `python3 code/section15.py results/joint_residue_tables_1e9.txt`
recomputes and asserts every decomposition and held-out number;
`code/artin_payoff resnull 1000000000 100` runs the residue-status null
(`results/resnull_1e9.json`).
